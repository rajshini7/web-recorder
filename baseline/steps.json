Its fossils have been found across North America, from Canada to Mexico.[7][8] It was about 25% larger than the modern lion, making it one of the largest known felids to ever exist, and a dominant apex predator in North American ecosystems,[9] alongside the sabertooth cats Smilodon and Homotherium.[10] It has been suggested, like modern lions, they were social animals, although this is not known for sure.[11][12] Unlike modern lions, American lions may have been a diurnal predator.[13]",
