# Web Recorder

Lightweight Node/TypeScript project for recording and replaying web interactions using Playwright.

## Prerequisites

- Install Node.js LTS (recommended >= 18) from https://nodejs.org
- npm is bundled with Node.js; you may also use `pnpm` or `yarn` if preferred

## Quick setup (Windows / PowerShell)

```powershell
cd C:\web-recorder
npm install
# Install Playwright browser binaries
npx playwright install
```

Notes:
- `npm install` reads dependencies from `package.json`. This repository lists the required libraries there.
- For reproducible installs, commit the generated `package-lock.json` and instruct contributors to run `npm ci`.

## Running

- Record interactions:

```powershell
npm run record
# or
npx ts-node src/recorder.ts
```

- Replay recorded interactions:

```powershell
npm run replay
# or
npx ts-node src/replay.ts
```

## Important files

- `package.json` — authoritative dependency manifest and scripts (`record`, `replay`).
- `requirements.txt` — informational summary of runtime and packages (human-readable reference).
- `src/recorder.ts` — recorder entrypoint.
- `src/replay.ts` — replay entrypoint.
- `steps/steps.json` and `steps.json` — recorded steps used by the replay logic.
- `replay-report.html` — output report generated by the replay (if applicable).

## Playwright notes

- Playwright requires browser binaries to be installed via `npx playwright install`.
- On some Linux systems, additional OS packages are required; see Playwright docs.

## Troubleshooting

- If `npx ts-node` fails, ensure `ts-node` and `typescript` are installed locally (they are listed in `package.json`).
- If Playwright cannot launch browsers, run `npx playwright install` and check your network/firewall.

## Contributing / Lockfile

- To produce a lockfile for deterministic installs, run `npm install` and commit `package-lock.json`.
- Prefer `npm ci` in CI environments for clean, reproducible installs using the lockfile.

## Questions

If you want, I can:
- Run `npm install` and `npx playwright install` here to verify everything installs correctly.
- Convert `devDependencies` to `dependencies` if you want the packages installed for production runs.
- Add short examples showing how the recorder/replay format works with `steps.json`.
