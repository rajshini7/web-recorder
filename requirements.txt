# Quick setup (PowerShell)
# 1) Install Node.js LTS from https://nodejs.org (manual on Windows)
# 2) From project root:
#    cd C:\web-recorder
#    npm install
# 3) Install Playwright browser binaries (required to run tests/scripts that launch browsers):
#    npx playwright install

# Notes
# - Prefer `package.json` and a lockfile (`package-lock.json`/`pnpm-lock.yaml`) to pin
#   exact dependency versions for reproducible installs. To create a lockfile, run
#   `npm install` and commit the generated `package-lock.json`.
# - If you want a pure Python-style `requirements.txt` for a different toolchain, tell me
#   which packages you need and I'll generate it.
